Render a scene of an architectural model.
Your renderer should include the ability to render reflective parts,
such as mirrors, and also generate appropriate shadows as generated by the items within the scene.
As the basis, you can use this room.
There are two frames on the wall represented by mesh242 and mesh243 which you can turn into mirrors using a
multi-stage rendering approach.
You can find an example for shadow maps here.
Results of the shadow map could look like this or this.
